Planning

## Notebook Tutorial

We provide 3 notebooks for a deep dive into planning for a Self Driving Vehicle (SDV).
Please refer to our [README](./examples/planning/README.md) for a full description of what you can achieve using them:

* you can train your first ML policy for planning using our [training notebook](./examples/planning/train.ipynb) \

* you can evaluate your model in the open-loop setting using our [open-loop evaluation notebook](./examples/planning/open_loop_test.ipynb) \

* you can evaluate your model in the closed-loop setting using our [closed-loop evaluation notebook](./examples/planning/closed_loop_test.ipynb) \
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lyft/l5kit/blob/master/examples/planning/closed_loop_test.ipynb)

We also provide pre-trained models for this task. Please refer to the [training notebook](./examples/planning/train.ipynb).
